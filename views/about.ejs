        <h2>Who I Am</h2>
        <p>
          Hello! I'm Brown Onuigbo, a passionate Software Engineer specializing
          in Node.js, Express, MongoDB, PHP, and JavaScript. With a strong
          foundation in both frontend and backend technologies, I enjoy building
          efficient, scalable, and user-friendly web applications. I am an
          Information Technology professional with extensive experience in
          application support and software development, with a proven track
          record of diagnosing and resolving complex technical issues. I thrive
          on ensuring the optimal performance of critical software applications
          while delivering exceptional customer service.
        </p>
        <br />

        <p>
          My academic background includes: • A Bachelor’s degree in Physics and
          Computing, • A Master’s degree in Computing and Information Systems
          from the University of Greenwich, London, and • A Ph.D. from Ignatius
          Ajuru University of Education, Port Harcourt, Nigeria. These academic
          experiences have provided me with a strong multidisciplinary
          perspective and deep technical expertise, which I apply to every
          project I undertake.
        </p>
        <br />

        <h3>What Drives Me</h3>
        <p>
          I am driven by the challenge of solving real-world problems through
          technology. I believe software development is not just about writing
          code—it's about creating meaningful solutions that improve lives,
          enhance businesses, and open up new possibilities. I am passionate
          about continuous learning, collaboration, and using technology to make
          a lasting impact.
        </p>
        <br />

        <h3>My Approach</h3>
        <p>
          I approach each project with a focus on user-centric design, clean
          architecture, and scalability. Whether working independently or as
          part of a team, I prioritize clear communication, thorough
          documentation, and agile practicesto ensure high-quality outcomes.
        </p>
        <br />

        <h3>Beyond Coding</h3>
        <p>
          When I'm not coding, I spend quality time with my wife and daughter,
          which brings me immense joy and balance. I also enjoy exploring new
          technologies, mentoring aspiring developers, traveling, playing game
          (Fifa), and participating in community initiatives that connect
          technology with everyday life. These activities keep me grounded and
          often inspire creative solutions to technical challenges.
